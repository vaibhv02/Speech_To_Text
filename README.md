## Explanation

This project also includes functionality to convert speech from an audio file back into text using IBM Watson's Speech to Text (STT) API. By utilizing the IBM Watson STT service, the project can take an audio file in MP3 format and transcribe the spoken words into written text.

The process begins by opening the audio file in binary mode. The audio data is then sent to the IBM Watson STT service using the `recognize` method. The service processes the audio using a specified language model, in this case, the `en-US_NarrowbandModel`, which is optimized for lower-quality audio, such as telephone recordings.

The `recognize` method sends the audio to the STT service, specifying that the content type is MP3. Once the audio is processed, the transcribed text is retrieved as a result and can be further used or analyzed within the project.

This part of the project is useful for converting spoken language into text, enabling further text-based processing, analysis, or storage.

## Skills Used

- **Python Programming:** Writing and understanding Python code to interact with external APIs and handle audio data.
- **API Integration:** Integrating IBM Watson's Speech to Text API, including setting up authentication and sending audio files for transcription.
- **Speech Recognition Technology:** Understanding how to convert spoken words from an audio file into text using advanced speech recognition models.
- **File Handling:** Managing and processing audio files in binary mode to ensure correct transmission to the API.
- **Error Handling:** Dealing with potential errors and exceptions that arise from API calls or file operations, such as incorrect parameters or missing files.
- **Model Selection:** Learning how to choose appropriate language models (`en-US_NarrowbandModel`) based on the quality and type of audio being processed.
